piece of him welcome horatio welcome good marcellus what has this thing appear d again tonight i have seen nothing horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching

twill not appear sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we two nights have seen well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this last night of all when yond same star that s westward from the pole had made his course t illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one peace break thee off look where it comes again enter ghost in the same figure like the king that s dead thou art a scholar speak to it horatio looks it not like the king mark it horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder barnardo it would be spoke to question it horatio what art thou that usurp st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak it is offended see it stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak _exit ghost _ tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on t before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he th ambitious norway combated so frown d he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak _the cock crows _ stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here _exit ghost _ tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently _exeunt _ scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell _exeunt voltemand and cornelius _ and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son _aside _ a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away _exeunt all but hamlet _ o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell _exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo _ my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes _exit _ scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind
